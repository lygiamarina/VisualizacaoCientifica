**Art Gallery problem**

Implementation: C++ and OpenGL (is glut permitted?)

1. Retrieve vertices
	a) Mouse click
		-Get mouse position
		-Turn mouse position into coordinates
	b) Construct vertices
		-Store using some structure
	c) Draw vertices
	
2. Draw edges
	a) Draw as the user clickes
	b) Does OpenGL permit edge drawing?
		-Yes: ok
		-No: draw triangle with angles' value zero
	c) Draw using previous vertice and new vertice
	
3. Triangulation
	Working on an algorithm
	
4. Draw vertices, edges and new edges from triangulation
	a) How to avoid redrawing?
